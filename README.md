## Farkas Weather Analysis for raspberry Pi

This code fetches data from [MPL3115A2](datasheets/MPL3115A2.pdf) and [Si7021](datasheets/Si7021.pdf) breakout boards, both built by Adafruit.

This is still a work in progress, but that data will eventually be fed into a display of current weather data also driven by the same script running on a Raspberry Pi.
